## Instructions:

1. Queries starting with "all schools..." will return full data (with latitude and longitude) to be plotted on a map
2. All other queries automatically group results by year. You may group results by one additional variable such as school level or district by adding "by school level" or similar text at the end of the query.
3. For testing purposes, I allow you to select any of the models I have trained but I recommend you use the latest one.
